# BulletHell
This Game is created to test two different Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment Systems

# Instructions
Thank you for agreeing to participate in my project. This will take about 30 minutes. Here's what you need to do:

- Below is a link to the game (Don't go there yet, keep reading). The game has 2 game modes, Mode X and Mode Y. While the mechanics of the game don't change between these gamemodes, the Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment System (DDA) used changes

- You can fullscreen the game by pressing F11. 

- This game can be played with keyboard & Mouse or Controller

- The game doesnt have any sound so I recommend listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/QvHoh0T5W7Y" target="_blank">this album by RichaadEB</a> while playing.

- I highly recommend you play through the tutorial first. It only takes about 30 seconds.

- Before you start playing, pick a game mode, either Mode X or Mode Y (they're at the bottom of the main menu)

- You do not need to beat each level on your first try. You can replay a failed level as many times as you want. That also means you can quit whenever you want, and please do fill in the survey response whether you finish the game or not.

- While playing, please think about how engaging the game is: how boring/challenging/frustrating is each level? You may want to go have a quick look at the survey before playing so you know what to be thinking about while playing

- If possible, please try both Modes. If you quit the first mode without completing it, please still try the second mode. You may want to take a break between playing each mode, But please make a note of which Mode you played first, as well as your lives lost, levels completed and anything else you may forget.

- Once you have completed both game modes (or just one if you don't have time for both), please complete the survey below (it's anonymous, so please answer as accurately as possible)
